**Make your own in a few minutes:**

1. **Fork** this project.
1. **Clone** it and install dependencies by running **`yarn install`**. (npm works just fine as well, your choice!)
1. **Update `now.json`** with your own redirects.
1. Deploy it to Vercel by running **`yarn deploy`**.
1. Configure your **custom domain** on the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) in the project settings.
1. Profit!

Set up the [Vercel GitHub integration](https://vercel.com/github) to **make adding redirects later on as simple as updating `now.json`** directly via the GitHub user interface. Your changes will be built and deployed automatically within seconds.
